**Microservices Platform for Hospital Solutions**
**Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a microservices-based Hospital Management System that streamlines key hospital functions such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and doctor-patient communication. Leveraging a client-server architecture, each service operates independently for scalability and modularity. Containerized using Docker and orchestrated via Docker Compose, the system is designed for efficient data handling, seamless scaling, and high availability. With cloud connectivity for real-time collaboration, this innovative solution enhances operational efficiency and patient care, setting a new standard for modern healthcare systems.
